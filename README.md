# my_portfolio_website
My potential portfolio website I created in my Intro to Web Development class with Professor Wergeles.

This website is incomplete. I need a better background, multiple tabs, external css, editing the onscreen buttons, along with a bunch of other fine tuning. Web Development has been fun so far and I am excited to get more websites up and running in the future.
